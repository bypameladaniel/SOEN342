### Note on Diagrams and Commit History

We were informed by our TA that all diagrams should have been committed to the GitHub repository before starting to commit code. While we had completed our diagrams early in the project, we mistakenly kept them stored locally and did not push them to the repository before committing code.

To provide evidence of our work, we have included a link to our Google Docs where the diagrams were created. By checking the document history, you can verify that the diagrams were added to the Google Docs starting on September 30th, which is well before our first code commit.

We hope this evidence helps clarify the timeline of our work and mitigates the impact on our grade. Thank you for your understanding.
